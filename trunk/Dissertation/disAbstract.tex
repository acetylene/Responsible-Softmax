Clustering algorithms are an important part of modern data analysis.  The K-means and EM clustering algorithm both use an iterative process to find latent (or hidden) variables in a mixture distribution.  In connection with these algorithms, we look at a random family of nonlinear mappings obtained via the joint distribution of a sample of size $N$ from a mixture of $K$ distributions.  We look at the dynamics of this family and give a proof of convergence.  We also show that the convergence is consistent in some sense.  We compare the answers obtained to those found by maximizing using Lagrange multipliers.
