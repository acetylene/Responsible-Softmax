\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to acknowledge everyone who had a very close hand in this work. 
My Advisor, Marek Rychlik, has been essential in his guidance and insight. I would also like to thank my committee, David Glickenstein, Clayton Morrison, and Robert Maier for their time and input. My family has been an excellent source of emotional support and motivation, I could not have come to this point without any of these people.
