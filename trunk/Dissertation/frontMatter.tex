\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to acknowledge everyone who had a very close hand in this work. 
My Advisor, Marek Rychlik, has been essential in his guidance and insight. Though it was a role he agreed to take on, I appreciate his patience in he;ping me finish. I would also like to thank my committee, David Glickenstein, Clayton Morrison, and Robert Maier for their time and input. This dissertation is much better for their input. 

My family also has been an excellent source of emotional support and motivation. My father, Thomas, has played a special role in helping me refine my thoughts during this process. Thanks for lending a listening ear and asking questions dad. My wife and children have been surviving with much less attention than they deserve for some time now. Their love and support has been demonstrably unconditional.

I could not have come to this point without any of these people, and many others I have failed to mention.
