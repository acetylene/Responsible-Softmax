function [ new_p ] = simplex_map( f_dist, old_p,method )
%SIMPLEX_MAP Take in the K by N paramaters f_dist and K by 1 input old_p to create new_p.
% new_p will be a K by 1 vector.
%
% The purpose of this map is to apply a nonlinear function defined by the
% parameters F_DIST, and apply it to the inpust OLD_P.  This function is
% useful in the study of K-means clustering.
%  F_DIST is an N by K matrix of values taken from K probability
%   distributions on N samples.  The only requirement on F_DIST is that the
%   entries are positive.
%  OLD_P is a 1 by K vector such that the sum of the entries is equal to 1.
%  NEW_P is a 1 by K vector such that the sum of the entries is equal to 1.


[K, N]=size(f_dist);
assert(length(old_p)==K);
%
% sums=sum(f_dist,2);
% for i=1:K
%     assert(sums(i)<=1);
